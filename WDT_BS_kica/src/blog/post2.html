            <p>I'm 23 years old university student with passion for games. Making games has become hobby for me.
                Since my teens I have been learning about game development. I tried modelling, programming, even designing games.
            <p>
                I started watching interesting videos related to game development, like Mark Brown's GMT series, reading game development
                books and learning the tools of the trade. I never finished most of my projects, I always scrapped the previous one and begun
                working on new one taking with me what I learned from the previous one.</p>
            <h3>SOČ</h3>
            <p>My first project that people could look at was my SOČ work I did back in 2017 in about 3 months.
                However, my heavy concentration on the theoretical part led to "unappealing" visuals:). Judge for yourself. PDF, standalone game.</p>
            <h3>My skills</h3>
            <p> While learning about game development, I realized that learning everything and mastering everything would not be an easy task.
                Thus, I oriented more towards programming game mechanics and graphics and sometimes modelling in Blender in my spare time.</p>
